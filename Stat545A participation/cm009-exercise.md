Reading and Writing Data: Exercises
-----------------------------------

Make a tibble of letters, their order in the alphabet, and then a pasting of the two columns together.

Make a tibble of three names and commute times.

Write the `iris` data frame as a `csv`.

Write the `iris` data frame to a file delimited by a dollar sign.

Read the dollar-delimited `iris` data to a tibble.

Read these three LOTR csv's, saving them to `lotr1`, `lotr2`, and `lotr3`:

-   <https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/blob/master/data/The_Return_Of_The_King.csv>

`gather()`
----------

(Exercises largely based off of Jenny Bryan's [gather tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/blob/master/02-gather.md))

This function is useful for making untidy data tidy (so that computers can more easily crunch the numbers).

1.  Combine the three LOTR untidy tables (`lotr1`, `lotr2`, `lotr3`) to a single untidy table by stacking them.

2.  Convert to tidy. Also try this by specifying columns as a range, and with the `contains()` function.

3.  Try again (bind and tidy the three untidy data frames), but without knowing how many tables there are originally.
    -   The additional work here does not require any additional tools from the tidyverse, but instead uses a `do.call` from base R -- a useful tool in data analysis when the number of "items" is variable/unknown, or quite large.

`spread()`
----------

(Exercises largely based off of Jenny Bryan's [spread tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/blob/master/03-spread.md))

This function is useful for making tidy data untidy (to be more pleasing to the eye).

Read in the tidy LOTR data (despite having just made it):

``` r
lotr_tidy <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/master/data/lotr_tidy.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Film = col_character(),
    ##   Race = col_character(),
    ##   Gender = col_character(),
    ##   Words = col_integer()
    ## )

Get word counts across "Race". Then try "Gender".

Now try combining race and gender. Use `unite()` from `tidyr` instead of `paste()`.

Other `tidyr` goodies
---------------------

Check out the Examples in the documentation to explore the following.

`expand` vs `complete` (trim vs keep everything). Together with `nesting`. Check out the Examples in the `expand` documentation.

`separate_rows`: useful when you have a variable number of entries in a "cell".

`unite` and `separate`.

`uncount` (as the opposite of `dplyr::count()`)

`drop_na` and `replace_na`

`fill`

`full_seq`

Time remaining?
---------------

Time permitting, do [this exercise](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/blob/master/02-gather.md#exercises) to practice tidying data.
